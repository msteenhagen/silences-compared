It is hard to say (since they themselves do not) why representationalists are unimpressed by the above points. Perhaps they disown some of the position I ascribed to them (points 1–4). Perhaps they think of representation as occurring in perception otherwise than as portrayed above. I will explore these possibilities by considering Gilbert Harman’s version of the view (see footnote 2). That version illustrates as well as any what might tempt one down representationalism’s primrose path. Discussing an undefended position, though, inevitably involves guesswork.

Of my four points, the first two---that the relevant representing is of such-and-such as so, and that it gives perceptual experience a face value---are taken from the mouths of representationalists. Anyone who renounces these points is not my target. As for the third point, the crucial part is that the relevant representing not be autorepresenting. Perceptual experience is a form of awareness of our surroundings. Perhaps we cannot have such awareness without registering at least some of what is around us. Perhaps to do that just is to autorepresent things as so. I take no stand here. If a representationalist wants to say no more than this, I will not cavil. McDowell, for one, insists that it is not all he wants to say. (Being represented to, though not yet, may become, a judgement.) And it is not all one does say in insisting that in perception we are represented to.

Not all representationalists speak explicitly of things being represented to the perceiver as so. But they are my target if they maintain the following: first, that a perceptual experience has a particular representational content (its content), namely, that such-and-such is so; second, that the perceiver can recognize this feature of it (as he would in grasping when the experience would be veridical, when not); third, that this is a content the perceiver may accept or reject (where accepting would be taking, or coming to take, what is thus represented as so to be so). To abbreviate, you are my target if you think experiences have a face value. This places at least all cited authors within my target range.

There is no more than the above in the idea that the relevant representation is allorepresentation, though the point need not be pressed. Allorepresentation requires something to do the representing. But that something can just be the perceptual experience itself, or else (the fact of) things looking as they did, or, again, things so looking. A representationalist need not balk at that.

As for point 4, a representationalist could, I think, disown the idea that content is looks-indexed. That is suggested by something Harman says. I thus drop the requirement, retaining only the requirement that this content is recognizable. That will prove not to help the representationalist’s case.

I will focus on four points in Harman’s view. Three are in this passage:

- Eloise is aware of the tree as a tree that she is now seeing. So, we can suppose, she is aware of some features of her current visual experience. In particular, she is aware that her visual experience has the feature of being an experience of seeing a tree. That is to be aware of an intentional feature of her experience; she is aware that her experience has a certain content. (Harman 1990, p. 38)

So in particular,

- __A__ When we are perceptually aware of something being so, or present, that is represented to us as so, or present. We are aware of seeing a tree, its brown trunk, its partly occluding other trees, etc. It is accordingly represented to us as so that there is a tree, it has a brown trunk, etc.

- __B__ We are aware of being represented to.<sup>19</sup> We are aware of our experience having the representational content that it does; we grasp what it is that is so according to it.

- __C__ To be aware that one’s experience is an experience of such-andsuch (or simply to be aware of experiencing such-and-such) is to be aware of its being represented to one that such-and-such. Experiencing seeing a tree is, per se, experiencing being represented to.

Harman also says this:

- Look at a tree and try to turn your attention to intrinsic features of your visual experience. I predict you will find that the only features there to turn your attention to will be features of the presented tree, including relational features of the tree ‘from here’. (Harman 1990, p. 39)

Neither a tree nor its features (being, looking, perhaps seeming, certain ways) does any representing. But that there is a tree which is, looks, etc., thus and so is what is represented as so. So the point here is to be:

- __D__ We are not aware of anything, other than, perhaps, the experience itself, which does the relevant representing, or bears the relevant content. We are aware of the familiar objects of perception, and of no further vehicle which contains a representation of them as present.


Points B and D suggest how to reject my point 4. They at least suggest that when I see a tree before me, it need not be that I have noted some looks I, on grounds of which I take that to be so. Nor need it be some look, or looks, from which I can see that I am so represented to. It is unclear that Harman would actually deny that the relevant content is looks-indexed. But anyway, if, in this case, it need not be gathered from (awareness of) something else that such-and-such is represented as so, then someone might deny it.

Recognition capacities may be of different sorts. In some cases, we can recognize a such-and-such, or its presence, and there is a story to be told about how we do that: certain observable features of the environment, to which we are perceptually sensitive (whether we note them or not) are a mark, for us, of the presence, or absence, of the relevant thing. Psychologists, I think, hope that facial recognition works like that. I suppose that my ability to tell a pig when I see one (such as it is) normally does too. In other cases, though, perhaps there is no such story. We can tell, as a rule, when the thing is present. But there is no describable function from other observable features of a situation to the cases in which we would recognize its presence. That idea, I think, is not absurd. If not, and if we are represented to in experience, then perhaps our ability to detect the content of such representing works like that. Point 4 should thus be weakened to allow this possibility. What remains is that the relevant being represented to is recognizable.

If we are represented to in perception, perhaps we can just tell how things are thus represented to us; there is no saying precisely how we can tell. It is still so, on Harman’s view, that we can tell; that we are aware of being represented to, and appreciate how things are thus represented. That raises two questions. First, what is it that we thus tell? When would an experience have given representational content? Or, for a given experience, just what content does it have? Second, in cases where we do see things, how does our being represented to relate to our seeing what we do?


I begin with the first question. I have already said why I think it has no answer. There is, I have argued, nothing in a perceptual experience to make it count as having some one representational content as opposed to countless others. Harman, though, says something that may sound like an answer. It is important to see why it is not one. First, though, we must face a peculiarity in Harman’s speech. I thus turn to his point D.

Harman insists that when Eloise is aware of seeing a tree, she is thereby aware that her experience has a certain intentional feature; namely, one of having such-and-such content. Exactly not, one would have thought. Intentionality, as usually conceived, is world-directedness. It is being hostage to the world’s favour for some success which the intentional item, as such, aims at. Whereas seeing is, per se, a success. For one to see a tree is for there to be one. There is nothing seeing as such aims at that has not already been achieved if it occurs at all. Which would make seeing a tree precisely not an intentional feature of experience.

Harman, though, rejects this view of seeing. Following Miss Anscombe, he believes that he can see things that are not there. So when he says Eloise to see a tree, he does not mean it to follow that there is one. If there is one, the seeing was a success. But she might have seen one anyway, on his proprietary use, even if there were not. That would make seeing intentional all right. In due course we will see good reason (aside from the obvious ones) not to talk that way. For the moment, though, I will need to put the relevant point in two ways. First, I will use ‘see’ to mean what it does; thus, as a success verb. Then I will try to speak in Harman’s way.

So, what representational content does a given perceptual experience have? What might make any answer to this question right of a given case? Harman tells us that if Eloise sees a tree before her, then it is represented to her as so that there is a tree before her. And similarly for anything else Eloise sees in her surroundings. But that does not answer the question. It covers the case where a tree is before her. But it is distinctive of representation (as opposed, say, to factive meaning) that it can be represented as so to Eloise that there is a tree before her when there is none. In which cases in which there is none is this represented to her as so? To put things another way, part of the representational content of Eloise’s experience, in the case Harman speaks of, is that there is a tree before her. But, for all we know so far, more may be represented to her as so than that; perhaps some of it falsely. What more? What makes the correct answer here correct?

There are familiar constraints on an answer. The cases where it is falsely represented as so to Eloise that such-and-such had better not just be those where she takes that such-and-such to be so---for example, where she falsely takes there to be a pig before her. That would reduce representation in perception to autorepresentation. That is not the view in question. Similarly, they had better not just be the cases where porcine presence is indicated: where a pig was to be expected, going by the looks. Nor, equally, should they just be cases where the perceiver did expect a pig going by the looks. For, as has been made clear, indicating is not representing. If representing merely echoed everything already indicated, it would be a (very annoying) wheel idling.

If how an experience represents things is fixed, somehow, by what the experience was like, one will not find the material for fixing this in demonstrable looks, for reasons already given. If looks matter at all---whether in specifiable ways or not---one is forced to the other side of the divide: to looks for which there is, per se, a way things should be to be the way they look simpliciter---looks which are the import of things looking as they do. That move gets one nowhere. For one thing, it only moves us into the domain of indicating. But should looks, or what an experience is like, matter at all to its representational content? Again, that we are represented to in experience is meant to be a familiar phenomenon; something we can tell is happening. It is not just events occurring in visual processing mechanisms of which we are all ignorant. It should not come as a complete surprise someday, to be sprung on us by future neurophysiologists, that we are thus represented to (uselessly, of course, since we were all ignorant of it). So yes. But, for reasons covered, there is just nothing in what perceptual experience is like to make the representational content of a given one some given thing as opposed to indefinitely many rivals.

Let us now try to use ‘see’ in Harman’s way. I will write this ‘see✵’. The idea is to be: I see✵ a pig before me just in case either there is a pig before me and I see it, or ...<sup>20</sup> What should follow this ‘or’? The familiar problems arise. Are the relevant cases just those in which I take myself to see a pig before me? Is autorepresentation the crucial feature here? If Harman wants to speak that peculiarly, fine. But now there is no plausibility in the idea that a pig is represented to me as there every time I see✵ one. Must I be so represented to in order to autorepresent? Can I not sometimes just take a pig to be indicated when it is not? In any case, since being represented to is one thing, and autorepresentation another, it still remains to say in general where the former phenomenon would occur. (To make the phenomena necessarily coextensive would just remove being represented to from the scene altogether.)

Perhaps, then, the relevant cases are just those in which the way things look suggests, or indicates, that there is a pig before me. (From the way that snout is twitching, I would say that it is a pig.) Again, a very strange use of ‘see’---to cover precisely what I cannot see, but must infer. But let that pass. For, again, suggesting, or indicating, is not representing. If these are supposed to be the cases in which it is represented to me as so that there is a pig before me, then such representation is entirely otiose; a mere re-rehearsing of what experience has otherwise made plain.

Or perhaps the relevant cases are just those where things look as the presence of a pig does, or might. (Without further explanation, this picks out no definite class of cases. But that does not matter to the present point.) There will then be many diverse cases where one sees✵ a pig. It cannot be that in all of these it is represented to one as so that there is a pig before one. That would make representation in perception incoherent, so not intelligibly representation at all. Too many things would thereby be represented as so at once. There are just too many things things look like.

Follow the ‘or’ with whatever you like, and it cannot be so that to see✵ a pig is to have it represented to one as so that there is one. The problems in filling the blank are just one reason among many why it is, as a rule, a bad idea to claim to see things that are not there. Just what are we to understand you to be doing? Harman’s problems in answering our first question, and, more particularly, in saying just what seeing✵ is supposed to be, are just McDowell’s in trying to make sense of ostensibly seeing. Ostensible seeing could, no doubt, just serve as seeing✵ if only we knew what it was.

I turn now to the second major question. Suppose there is a pig before me, and I see it. That is one case in which, according to Harman, it is represented to me as so that there is a pig before me. Just what is the relation supposed to be between these two things---my seeing the pig, and my being thus represented to? There are two ways of conceiving the matter. On the one, I have two separate sources of information. I am aware of two different things: first, the pig; second, being represented to. Awareness of neither carries with it, ipso facto, awareness of the other. I see the pig; it is otherwise intimated to me, redundantly, that there is one. On the other, there is but one source. I am represented to, and cognizant of that. To be aware of all that I thus am just is, where I do see a pig before me, my doing that. It may constitute that awareness of a pig before me that seeing one (to be there) is.

On the two-source view, I experience, in the relevant cases, its being represented to me as so that there is a pig before me. I am unmediatedly aware of that. Sometimes, when there is a pig before me, I am also unmediatedly aware of something else: the pig before me. I see it, and, in addition, it is represented to me as so. I thus have, twice over, reason to take it that there is a pig, each reason different in kind, each independent of the other. Perhaps whenever I see a pig, this other experience, being represented to, tags along. But it is never my sole source of awareness of the pig. It is an extra intimation or porcine presence. Sanity would be hard won if representation in experience were thus both inescapable and redundant---like a relative at the movies, reciting what you have just seen. Where I see a pig, that further intimation of one is gratuitous. Where I do not, and no pig is indicated, it carries no conviction. But experience is obviously not that way. No one thinks it is.

What remains is the one-source model. On the one hand, the idea is, I experience whatever I do in its being represented to me as so that there is a pig before me. On the other, I experience whatever I do in seeing there to be a pig before me. The idea is: though the first may occur without the second, where the second occurs at all, these two things are as one: for me to experience the second thing, where I do, is just for me to experience the first, and whatever else, on that occasion, doing that much amounts to experiencing. I need have experienced nothing I could then have failed to experience in experiencing that much.

In experiencing the first thing, I am aware, in a certain way, of certain things. Mutatis mutandi for my experiencing the second thing. By hypothesis, all there is for me to be aware of in the second instance is what there is for me to be aware of in the first, plus whatever experiencing that much then makes for me experiencing. So I am aware of no more than whatever I am in my experiencing the first, plus whatever that awareness then amounts to awareness of. So what I am aware of in seeing a pig (to be before me) is no more than that.

How may awareness of X amount to awareness of Y? It may just be that; or it may make for that---be all or part of what makes one count as aware of Y. I may experience all I do just in its being represented to me that there is a pig before me without a pig before me. So for me to be aware of what I am precisely in experiencing that cannot just be for me to be aware as I am of (seeing) a pig before me. What it might do, sometimes, where there is a pig before me, is make for awareness of that. It, and surrounding conditions, may make me count as aware of that. The hope must be that the awareness this delivers is that which I have in seeing a pig to be before me.

As a rule, awareness of something else plus satisfaction of surrounding conditions cannot add up to that awareness of porcine presence which we have in seeing one (to be there)---in my terms, unmediated awareness. Or, more exactly, if X is something there might be even without Y, then awareness of X (and whatever accompanies it per se in a particular case) cannot qualify as unmediated awareness of Y---the sort one might have in seeing Y. The rule holds where X is its being represented to one that Y is so (or present), where representation takes any of the forms we are familiar with. It holds equally, in familiar cases, where X is whatever is a part of the being represented to as such---uttering some words, say.

For example, Pia may learn there are pigs about by being told. She might, that is, if she is, or was, aware of being told. Being told, in that case, may qualify her as aware that there are pigs about. It might do that; but only sometimes. Not, for one thing, if she refuses, or omits, to take there to be pigs about. Not, for another, if she was not told because it was so---if that telling did not mean that there were pigs about. And not, for a third, if she was not entitled to rely on that. All these are things that sometimes happen. So her being told qualifies her as aware that there are pigs only given certain quite substantial contingencies.

These features make for mediated awareness, if any. They distinguish mediated from unmediated awareness. With the unmediated awareness one has in seeing there to be pigs, Pia cannot refuse, or omit, to take pigs to be present. The limitation is grammatical, not psychological.<sup>21</sup> To see there to be pigs about is, inter alia, to be aware of seeing them, or of their presence. One’s stance on that score is thus set; one’s mind made up. Further, if what she is thus aware of---the presence of pigs---means that there are pigs, that is not something it might or might not do all depending. So no substantial entitlement is needed, where one goes on that, to take there to be pigs.

The difference between seeing pigs and merely having it represented to one that there are pigs is not exhausted by such marks. In that unmediated awareness of a pig which is seeing it to be there, it is the pig itself whose presence forms my cognitive responses to it. It is its doings themselves which make me privy to them. I need not follow at one remove, by following the career of something else, and taking the pig’s career to be what it then must be. I need not, in particular, keep track of how I am being represented to, or of whatever it is that does the representing.<sup>22</sup> Its being represented to me as so that there are pigs about may make me aware that there are; but (in familiar cases) it cannot deliver awareness of that sort---awareness in which no more than the relevant porcine doings is required for keeping me au fait with the changing, or changeable, porcine state of affairs; in which I need follow nothing else to keep abreast of its continuation or extinction.

I have so far spoken of a familiar form of being represented to: being told. What it delivers is at best mediated awareness of what is told. That should be undisputed. Why might one think that representation could work differently where it is in, or as part of, a perceptual experience that something is represented as so? Here is a line of thought. In your representing it to me as so that there are pigs about, there is both more and less for me to be aware of than there is when there are pigs about. There must be more; for even if you produce a virtual reality pig simulation, there must be something to indicate that this is to be taken as representing what is so, rather than, say, as representing what it would be like if it were so. There will also be less: the pig itself is no part of your representing; and, typically, your representing will look and sound nothing like a pig before me. By contrast, the line goes, where, in a visual experience, it is represented to me as so that there is a pig before me, such differences, or any that are phenomenological, are all erased. There need be, in such an experience, no more for me to be aware of than there might be where I saw a pig to be before me. There need not be quite as much for me to be aware of as there is where there is a pig before me, since there need be no pig (such representation can be false). But such an experience will be just like one of seeing a pig before me in this sense: in it things will look, or seem, just as a pig before me would, or might. There need be nothing further it is like for it to be one in which I am so represented to; and nothing less will do. So I have such an experience just where things look, or seem, that way.

The idea does not work. On the one-source model, I need be aware of nothing more in my experience than I am in my awareness of being represented to for it to be (made) so that I see a pig before me---that I am aware of its so being as I thus would be. Nor could I be aware of less---it is not as if I have some other way of being, or qualifying as, aware that a pig is present. But all I am thus aware of is what might be there for me to be aware of even if there were no pig. That leaves room for me, fully recognizing all that, to refuse to take it that there is a pig there; room for all that not to mean that there is a pig there (even if, in fact, there is one); and so on. The marks of mediated awareness of a pig before me thus remain. And that would not be seeing one to be there. Perhaps I may sometimes count as having been aware, in a given experience, of the presence of a pig, and sometimes count merely as having been aware of things looking that way. It would be a mistake to take that to mean that my awareness of things looking that way could ever count as awareness of a pig before me, or could make for more than mediated awareness of that.

The idea is anyway a non-starter, for familiar reasons. On it, a visual experience is to be one in which it is represented to me as so that there is a pig before me just where in it things look as a pig does (or might) standing before me. One could draw the look in question. It is, if anything, a demonstrable look; thus equally a way things would, or might look if any of countless other things were so---for example, if there were a peccary before me. So, on the idea, this would also be an experience in which it was represented to me as so---for example---that there was a peccary before me. Nor would that be a matter of representing two different things as before me. The idea thus gives visual experiences incoherent content.

There is a fundamental problem. On the idea, an experience is identified as one in which it is represented to me as so that there is a pig before me by the way, in it, things look or seem, or by their looking, or seeming, as they do. As we have seen, there is nothing in things looking as they do to make anything the way things should be for an experience to be veridical---if it did represent, for things to be as represented. The one-source model requires our being represented to in perceptual experience to be representation of an extraordinary kind. But the idea of such extraordinary representation is bankrupt. The postulated representing is to be found neither in what we experience, nor in our responses to it, where one finds but autorepresenting. The one-source model thus fails. That leaves no room in perceptual experience for things to be represented to us as so. Autorepresentation aside, perceiving what we do has no representational content.

Harman writes, 

- Perceptual experience represents a particular environment of the preceiver. ... The content of perceptual representation is functionally defined in part by the ways in which this representation normally arises in perception and in part by the ways in which the representation is normally used to guide actions. (Harman 1990, p. 46)

Perhaps it is experience’s sources, and not its looks, that give it content. But that idea leads nowhere. Issues of normalcy arise for repeatably enjoyable experience types. Whereas what we need to fix content for are particular experiences, such as the visual experience I am having now, say, with a pig before me. Any particular experience instances countless types. Which of these matter to its content? Certain types obviously cannot. My experience belongs to the type seeing a pig. But that I do, in fact, see one cannot make that represented to me as so. On Harman’s account, a tree is represented to Eloise as before her just where, in his proprietary sense, she sees one. Whether she does that is meant to be a matter of how things look. So perhaps it is looks that, somehow, type experiences relevantly. These had better be demonstrable looks on pain of misreading autorepresentation as being represented to.

We may, perhaps, ask how experiences so typed ‘normally’ arise---in my life, in human existence, or whatever. Perhaps some one such type is thus due to porcine presence.<sup>23</sup> Its action-guiding force might, for all that, be almost anything, depending on how one autorepresents an instance of it. One who takes himself to see a peccary in some one instance will be guided differently from one who thus takes himself to see a pig. But autorepresenting cannot fix how one was represented to. That leaves the proposal only this type’s source to fix its content. So any experience of this type, so mine, will be one in which a pig was represented to the perceiver to be before him---even where he plainly saw a peccary.

But do demonstrable looks identify types that thus matter to content? Do they matter to content in some determinate way? We have seen why they do not. If they did, they would give an experience a face value. Where things were not, in fact, as they are according to that face value, the experience would be, ipso facto, deceptive, or non-veridical. To trust the experience would be to take it at face value. If looks fix, or identify, face value, that would be to take things to be as they look. But demonstrable looks do not make any way the way things should be to be the way they look; nor do we suppose they do; nor is it them as such in which we trust. So they cannot type experiences that fix content. Nor does anything else.<sup>24</sup>

The fundamental problem is this. Being represented to in experience was meant to be a familiar phenomenon. That an experience would be deceptive, or non-veridical, unless such-and-such were so is something an experiencer was supposed to recognize about it. There is no such familiar phenomenon. There is thus no such work for sources of experience to do. Perception is not the stuff of which things might be represented to us as so. It is, in a crucial way, not an intentional phenomenon.<sup>25</sup>
