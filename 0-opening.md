# The Silences of the Senses
__Charles Travis__

- _Abstract:_ On a current view, in perceptual experience things, or things perceived, are represented as being (perhaps to be) thus and so (where it is not the perceiver who thus represents things to himself). This chapter begins to detail the reasons why that idea is a non-starter. One crucial idea: verbs of perception, such as ‘see’ and ‘looks’, have non-perceptual uses (such as ‘I see what you mean’). Impressions of representing in or by experience are engendered by confusing the two. Some think the view must be right on pain of one or another dire consequence. The essay works to dispel that idea.

Perhaps the most common view of perception today is that it is representational: that in perceptual experience---in our seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, what we do---the world is represented to us as being thus and so. If we help ourselves to a far from innocent count noun, we may shorten the view’s expression: a (given) perceptual experience has (given) representational content. In no case I am aware of is this view argued for. Rather, it is assumed from the outset. Some, perhaps, assume it _faute de mieux_, seeing representation as better material than ‘qualia’ for answering a very special question as to what an experience was like: a question whose answer would identify, precisely, and once and for all, what that experience was like (such as visually) _for the subject_, as thus experienced. That special question, as conceived, would demand an answer mentioning nothing there is _for one_ to meet in his surroundings. What follows should suggest why _nothing_ answers such a very special question. Some may be moved by the thought that perceptual experience, being mental, is intentional, and that intentionality just is that sort of _aiming_ at the world which representation is. If intentionality is so construed, the present brief shows it to be but one form of the mental: perception, and experience, exemplify another. In any event, perception is not representational. What follows will show why.
