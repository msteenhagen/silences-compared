# The Silence of the Senses
__Charles Travis__

- _Abstract_: There is a view abroad on which (a) perceptual experience has (a) representational content in this sense: in it something is represented to the perceiver as so. On the view, a perceptual experience has a face value at which it may be taken, or which may be rejected. This paper argues that that view is mistaken: there is nothing in perceptual experience which makes it so that in it anything is represented as so (except insofar as the perceiver represents things to himself as so). In that sense, the senses are silent, or, in Austin’s term, dumb. Perceptual experience is not as such either veridi- cal or delusive. It may mislead, but it does not take representation to accomplish that.

Perhaps the most common view of perception today is that it is representational: that in perceptual experience---in our seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, what we do---the world is represented to us as being thus and so. If we help ourselves to a far from innocent count noun, we may shorten the view’s expression: a (given) perceptual experience has a (given) representational content. In no case I am aware of is this view argued for. Rather it is assumed from the outset. Some, perhaps, assume it _faute de mieux_, seeing representation as better material than ‘qualia’ for answering a very special question as to what an experience was like: for an experience to have been like what it was would be precisely for what answered that question to obtain. What follows should _suggest_ why _nothing_ answers such a very special question.<sup>1</sup> Some may be moved by the thought that perceptual experience, being mental, is intentional, and that intentionality just is that sort of _aiming_ at the world which representation is. If intentionality is so construed, the present brief shows it to be but one form of the mental: perception, and experience, exemplify another. In any event, perception is not representational. What follows will show why. The urge thus to transform ordinary questions as to what an experience was like may arise from a prior felt need to say what it was for an experience to have been the experience it was, without mentioning anything to be met with in experience whether then experienced or not. That is another urge worth fighting.
