# Thinkable Appearance

Consider, first, words like these: ‘It looks like (looks as if, looks as though) Pia will sink the putt/that painting is a Vermeer/Pia’s sister is in town’. Here what the grammatical object speaks of which is said to enjoy a certain status. Here ‘looks like’ takes a sentential object. Grammatically, its subject might be viewed as a dummy. One might also think of the subject here as just _things_, in that catholic sense of ‘things’ in which it is a _bêtise_ to ask which ones. Things being as they are, or simply the way things are, is what makes it look as if Pia will sink the putt, or the painting is a Vermeer. Or, more exactly, it is what is in evidence, made known, as to how things are---what, from the relevant position, has been, or can be, recognized as to this, which makes things look this way.

I will take the central case to be one in which the speaker, in saying this, represents himself as subscribing to a view as to how things are: while the mentioned proposition (for example, that the painting is a Vermeer), has not quite been established, nevertheless it is the thing for one to suppose, at least _pro tem_, given what is known, or revealed, of how things are. Going only on what is known (or revealed), such is what one _would_ suppose. If that is the central case, there are, of course, derivatives. Van Meegeren’s task was to fool the Nazis into buying fake Vermeers. Complimenting him on his success at that, I might say, ‘It looks just as if that painting is a Vermeer’, knowing full well that it is not: there is a position from which things would so look---the position we hope the Nazis to occupy. From that position---the position of one not in the know as Van Meegeren and I are---that it is a Vermeer would be the thing to think. (Now we need only hope that the Nazis are rational about this.)

What matters here is not how cases are divided into primary and derivative, but rather the general sort of thing that is said on such a use of ‘looks like’ or ‘looks as if’. It is a remark about the thing to think, or at least what the speaker finds the thing to think. Now the central point is this: awareness that something is the thing to think (or, on some qualification, the qualified thing to think) is not _visual_ awareness. So wherever ‘looks like’ has anything like the suggested readings, awareness of it looking like P will not be visual, or perceptual awareness. The point holds wherever ‘looks like’ takes a sentential complement, or at least where that complement is to be understood as what does the mentioned looking. For there is nothing which that Pia will sink the putt, or that the painting is a Vermeeer, looks like. _That such-and-such_ is not the sort of thing to have a look. Unlike, say, the lemon on the counter, it is not the sort of thing to form images---a point of Frege’s, who thus says of ‘see’ what might be said of ‘looks like’ on such uses: that it really speaks of a form of thought, or judgement. (See 1897: p. 153.)

I will call the looks spoken of on such uses of ‘looks like’, ‘looks as if’, and so on, _thinkable looks_. They are not looks to be achieved simply by assuming the right shape, colouration, and so on. They are not possessed by what _is_ shaped and coloured as such; not instanced in the world simply in objects, or scenes, looking as they do, being such as to form the visual images they would. They are rather what is to be made of things by a thinker relevantly _au fait_ with the world, and knowing enough of what to make of what he is thus aware of.

Suppose that, beginning with ‘It looks like Pia will sink the putt’, we substitute for ‘Pia will sink the putt’, ‘it is a lemon’, the ‘it’ referring, say, to a very lifelike wax lemon. Then the first ‘it’ remains ‘dummy’. That is, we get: _things look as if that thing is a lemon._ We thus get the use just discussed. But in ‘It looks as if it is a lemon’, the two ‘it’s may be coreferential. This _may_ just be an idiomatic variant of the locution already discussed (as when one says, ‘that putt here looks as if it will be sunk’). But it may also bear a different understanding. What remains so, on this understanding, is that it is a way of attributing a certain status to (the proposition) that that thing is a lemon; one having to do with its credibility, or likelihood. What may change here is what is represented as conferring that status: it is what the lemon, in looking as it does, makes evident as to how things are which gives the proposition that status. Where ‘looks like’ is so read, all the above points hold, most crucially that awareness of the object looking like a lemon (where that is its looking to be one, or its making things look as if it were) is not _perceptual_ awareness---Frege’s point applied again.

The second notion of _look_ I mean to present here is thus one on which looking is a matter of some proposition enjoying some status or other _in re_ being the thing to think. Looking like, on this notion, is a matter of things, or something, having a certain rational force regarding some given proposition; a certain bearing on the thing to think. Such looks, thinkable looks, are not visual looks in the present sense. The _locution_, ‘It looks like (it is) a lemon’ (coreferential ‘it’s) and its kin may sometimes speak of visual looks---of it looking (in some respect or degree, to be understood from context) as a lemon would. A visual look is a look exemplified, _per se_, in a given thing looking as it does---a thing, that is, liable to have a look, liable to form images. However one understands _looking like a lemon_, or _looking pockmarked_, or _looking waxy_, or any other look a wax lemon might have---however waxy, or pitted, something must look to count as looking waxy, or pitted, in the meaning of the act---whether a given object has (or given doings have) that look is decided solely by (or in) its (their) looking as it does (they do). It is a matter of _visual_ comparisons. Whereas whether, for example, some object looks like (it is) a lemon, where this speaks of thinkable looks, is never decided simply by its looking as it does. To adapt a point of Austin’s, when wax lemons get good enough, and are widely enough distributed, it will cease to be true that you can tell by looking whether something is a lemon, so that what now makes things look that way, so makes there be a certain thinkable look, may cease to do so. Things will no longer so thinkably-look.

All of this is just for the sake of ensuring that visual looks and thinkable looks are not conflated. Holding them safely apart, we may ask which sort of look might give either reason, or means, for taking perceptual experience to have representational, truth-evaluable, content. _Visual_ looks are the sort of thing to be decided just by looking. Any given such look is such as to be exhibited in some given range of cases, where what members of the range need to share in common is some identifiable _visual_ resemblance. On this notion of _look_, something looking waxy, or pitted, or like a lemon, or a Vermeer, need carry no suggestion that it _is_ waxy, pitted, a lemon, or a Vermeer. Its right to membership in the given class is in no way compromized by absence of such suggestion. The trouble now, as discussed already, is that there are too many things something would look _like_ in looking the way it thus does---all the things, in fact, which belong to the class of things which so look. It might as well _be_ any of these as any other, purely so far as its _visual_ looks go. Nothing in its visual looks distinguishes any of these as what it ought to _be_ to be as represented, if for it to look visually as it does were for anything to be represented as so. Visual looks, properly wielded, might be the _vehicle_ of some representing; but _they_, on their own, hardly identify what that representing would be.

So we might look to the second notion for means to identify such content. This notion, thinkable looks, _is_ a matter of what can be gathered from, or what is suggested by, the facts at hand, or those visibly (audibly, and so on) on hand. So it cannot look as if X on this notion where it is perfectly plain that X is not so. Further, it look as if X only where one has not actually seen, or observed (for himself) that X is so; in which case there would be nothing to gather.

On this second notion, if it looks as if Pia’s sister is approaching, or as if the painting is a Vermeer, then there is a way things should be, _simpliciter_, for things to be the way they thus look: Pia’s sister should be approaching; the painting should actually be a Vermeer. For all that, it may not be Pia’s sister approaching. It may be Pia’s sister, but retreating, or no-one at all, mere light and shadows. In that case, _something_ is deceptive (whereas Pia looking, on the first notion, like her sister without being her does not yet make anything deceptive). It is perhaps just this feature of looks on this second notion that makes perception appear (to some) to represent things as so. But all depends here on what it is that is deceptive.

If perception represented things to us as thus and so, there would have to be, for any instance of it, a way things were according to it. Looks, on this second notion, where, or insofar as, there are any, identify something such a way _might_ be. So far, that is all to the good for the representationalist. They are not, on the other hand, what might serve as _vehicles_ of content---the sort of thing that might make representing recognizable to one. There is no particular visual look present in, or by, things looking like/as if X where this is a thinkable look. Things look like X in this sense _wherever_ X is how things should be to be the way they look. Such is not a further fact made recognizable by things so looking. Nor, if the way things should be to be the way they look were the way they should be to be as represented, would looks in this sense be some perceptible cue to _that_ fact. If perception were representational, looks in this second sense might _be_ its representational content; but they could not be what made that content recognizable for us.

But for it to look such-and-such way, where this is a thinkable look, cannot be for it to be represented _to the perceiver_ that such-and-such is so. _Perhaps_ for it so to look to _me_ is for me so to (auto)represent things to _myself_ (though not for me to be represented to from any other source). For it so to look full stop might be (roughly) for it to be the thing for _one_ to autorepresent (unless specially in the know), going on what there is here for _one_ to go one. But it is certainly not for _me_ to be represented to, either by myself, or from some other source.

Suppose I say ‘It looks to Sid as if the painting is a Vermeer’, or again, ‘as if Pia will win the tournament (will sink the putt)’. I thus credit Sid with a certain view of a certain matter. I say him to take it, perhaps tentatively, hesitantly, with some uncertainty, that, for example, Pia will win the tournament. (I will not speak correctly if Sid knows full well that Pia will win the tournament, or that the painting is a Vermeer. But it will be safe to waive that point here. I will not speak _truly_ if Sid does not think the painting is (even probably) a Vermeer, or so on.)

Suppose, now, that I say simply ‘It looks as if Pia will sink the putt’ (or whatever). To begin with, that is properly understood as (_inter alia_, perhaps) an expression of my own---perhaps tentative and hesitant---view of the matter: I think, or am inclined to think, going on the facts in hand, that she will sink it. I may have done no more than say how things thus seem to me; in which case I could have spoken more explicitly by saying ‘It looks _to me_ as if Pia will sink the putt’. Here, speaking of looks indicates explicitly that I am going by what I take it can be gathered from the facts in hand, or from things looking as they do. (Thus my view is about what I have not actually observed.)

But there may be more to an ‘It looks as if P’ than that. If I say ‘It looks as if this car has been repainted’, I may be saying that, again going by the looks---by what is observable, or perhaps more generally, by all the facts in hand---_one can conclude_ with some, though perhaps not complete, certainty, that the car has been repainted. That, according to me, is what the looks, or the facts in hand, indicate. I am mistaken if they do not indicate that: I mistake a bit of undercoat for the original colour, say. Whether I am right or wrong depends on what things (factively) mean (or ought to)---a crucial feature of this second notion.

It may look to Sid as if the painting is a Vermeer when, in fact, it does not at all look as if it is a Vermeer; it has all the characteristics of a van Meegeren---a subject matter and style of dress, say, never found in Vermeer. There are observer-independent facts as to what looks to be the case, however occasion-sensitive a matter it is what counts as such a fact. When would a painting not, in fact, look like a Vermeer? When, for example, the woman sweeping the courtyard is using a type of broom not made until the eughteenth century, or is wearing a hat never worn in Holland; or when the brush strokes are a bit too broad to be Vermeer’s, or feather in the wrong way, or the pigments are a little off. When does it not look as if Pia will sink the putt? When, for example, the ball is on a straight course for the hole, where it would have to be off to the right to catch the roll nearer the cup. When would it not look as if there are fresh roses in the vase? When, for example, the petals (if you look closely) are a bit too waxy to be real; or, again, when one is in an artificial flower shop. When would it not look as if Pia (marked as she is) had been in a fight? When, for example, her dog often drags her through brambles, so that you cannot tell by looking whether she has been in a fight or not.

We are now on familiar ground. The thing about the broom is that it _means_ (factively) that the painting was not done by Vermeer. Or if, unaccountably, Vermeer painted such a broom, then, though it does not mean that, one might have expected it to. Conversely, if, on inspection, the looks (first notion) really are distinctively the looks of a Vermeer---if that is the way he painted---then that _indicates_ that it is a Vermeer. In which case, on this second use of ‘look’, it looks, so far, like (as if) it is a Vermeer. One may so conclude. Again, the course of the ball means that it will catch the lie wrong, and hence miss the cup. If it does not miss---there is a freak guest of wind, or the earth moves---then, though that course did not mean that she would miss, one might rightly have expected so.

What things look like on this use of ‘looks’ is thus a matter of what things mean factively, or indicate; of how the world is contingently arranged. That is precisely not a matter of things being represented as so. Representation simply does not work that way. Whether it was represented to us as so that Pia will sink the putt is never a matter of whether her sinking it was indicated. Nor, by contrast with factive meaning, can it be decided by whether she did in fact sink it, so that if not, then, _ipso facto_, no such thing was represented as so.

So we have two notions of looks, neither of which allows looks to decide what was _represented_ as so. Things looking (visual looks) as they do fixes no way things should be to be the way they look full stop; nor, _a fortiori_, to be as represented. Things just have too many visual looks in looking visually as they do. It/things looking like/as if what it does/they do (thinkable looks) fixes a way things should be to be the way they look full stop. But to take that to fix what was _represented_ as so would collapse representation into indicating, or factive meaning, and thus to lose it altogether.

I have now distinguished two notions _look_s---a distinction Frege drew (see 1897, 1918). There are _visual_ looks, objects of _visual_ awareness. And there are _thinkable_ looks---objects of judgement, or thought. There are two main sorts of statements of visual looks: one ascribing some such look in particular; the other merely noting a resemblance between the looks of one thing and that of another. ‘Pia looks just like her sister’ may be used for either thing: one may identify a look in citing her sister as instancing it (so that things are as said only if Pia looks _thus_, for something ‘thus’ may thus refer to); or one may merely say Pia and her sister to resemble one another visually. Statements about thinkable looks also come in two notable varieties: so to speak, committed or not. ‘That painting looks just like (looks to be) a Vermeer’ may express a judgement as to what is probably so, or ought to be supposed so, given the speaker’s exposure to how things are. Or it may express no such commitment on the speaker’s part, merely say what _someone_ would suppose, on given available grounds, if not further in the know. For example, an accomplice might say this to van Meegeren, knowing the painting to be a van Meegeren. This variety in statements does not disturb the underlying taxonomy of looks.

# Hybrids

Neither notion suits the representationalist. He might thus seek a third. Both the temptation and its execution are visible in McDowell’s effort to explain a notion of ‘ostensibly seeing’. Ostensibly seeing is to be either of two cases. One disjunct is simply seeing something to be so---say, there to be a pig before one. One has the pig manifestly in view. In terms McDowell favours, its presence stands revealed. The other disjunct is a class of ringers for the first. It is not obvious just which class McDowell means to capture. In any case, he appeals to _some_ notion of looks for doing so. As he explains things,

- Ostensible seeings are experiences in which it looks to their subject as if things are a certain way.

He then says this about the relevant notion of looks:

- Even if one does judge that things are as they look, having them look that way to one is not the same as judging that they are that way. In some cases, perhaps, one does judge that things are a certain way when they look that way. But…unless there are grounds for suspicion, such as odd lighting conditions, having it look to one as if things are a certain way---ostensibly seeing things to be that way---becomes_accepting that things are that way by a sort of default. (McDowell 1998: pp. 438–9, my italics)

McDowell clearly cannot mean ‘looks as if (indicative)’ in its normal English sense. So read, for it to look to one as if X _is_ for one to take it that X; for one’s mind to be made up. It is not to keep the option of accepting, or rejecting, ‘at face value’, that things are that way. Nor is it to be in a condition that may _evolve_ into judgement. It _is_ to judge. This fits with the first disjunct of what McDowell means to capture. Where I _see_ the pig to be before me, my mind _is_ made up. Nothing remains (on that score) for me to take at face value or not. The world has already drawn credence from me. To see that such-and-such is so is to take it to be so.

So reading it may not fit well with what McDowell means to capture in the other disjunct. What unites the ringers in the cases where it looks to me as if there is a pig before me is nothing other than the fact that I so take it---that I am, thus, fooled. No visual look, for example, is present in all these cases. There need not even be any such thing as a visual look in every such case---certainly not a porcine one. This class would not be the same as the class in which things look as they would were there a pig before me (however exactly one identifies that class). What all its members would share in common with all instances of the first disjunct is only a bit of autorepresentation, not a visual likeness. Looking as if X is meant to be a feature shared by all instances of either disjunct. But autorepresentation is implausibly the right feature.

It is clear to some extent what notion McDowell wants. First, it should be possible, on it, for it to look (to N) as if X, while, for all that, _not_ X (so that there may be a face value). Second, it should be possible for it to look to N as if X, on this notion, even when N is entirely agnostic as to whether X (so that looks may be taken or left at face value). So, too, it should be possible for it to look as if X, on the notion, even though X is not to be concluded, even tentatively, from---is not indicated at all by---the facts in hand, or placed by the experience in hand. It looks as if it is a Vermeer; we _know_ it is a van Meegeren.

The relevant sense must make this attitude coherent, ‘That, anyway, is how things look (to me); as to what there is reason to think, that is quite another matter’. For that, the way things (first sense) look (to N)---what is fixed by their visual looks, so viewed---must fix how, in the relevant sense, they look to N.

There is nothing wrong with a notion that works in that way. Though there are ordinary means of expressing it, McDowell may choose whatever means he likes. It is the next step that makes everything go wrong. For McDowell also wants a look in his sense to carry as such a given import: for it to be present is, as such, for such-and-such thereby (at least) to be suggested; so for there to be a way things should be to be the way they look full stop. Only then could there be such a thing as judging (all the more refusing to judge) that things are as they look. Only then could there be any such thing to judge; such a thing as things being, or not, as they look.

This feature of McDowell’s notion makes looking in his sense contrast with having a visual look. A visual look, like any other visible thing, may sometimes indicate something. But that is a contingent matter. A porcine look sometimes indicates a pig, but need not. All that visual looks fix as to how things look fixes _no_particular way things should be to be the way they look full stop. (Nor would fixing what is indicated fix what _representation_ requires.) But, in meeting the first desideratum, what is thus fixed _would_ fix how things look to N in McDowell’s sense. So how things look to N in that sense cannot fix what way things should be to be the way they look. The two desiderata cannot consistently be fulfilled by _any_ notion of looks.

McDowell wants to mix two immiscible notions. Looking as if X is to be what unites the two disjuncts of McDowell’s ‘ostensibly seeing’. It is to be what is in common to a pig being visibly before me, and the relevant cases of the mere appearance of that. For that he needs a look in his sense to be identified (as present or absent in any given case) as looks in our first sense are: there will be a ringer wherever things (as seen by me) look suitably as they would were there a pig before me. Just so is the occurrence of a ringer independent of what is indicated by, or what I make of, things (as viewed by me) looking as they do. Just that holds looks in his sense apart both from autorepresentation and from indicating. McDowell must draw on our first notion of a look to block that collapse. Such looks are just what _is_ independent of indicating, and of autorepresentation.

McDowell thus needs looks in our first sense, so visual looks, to have intrinsic import: for such a look to do what a thinkable look does: to make, _per se_, for a way things should be to be the way they look full stop. Only that would give an appearance the right shape to evolve into a judgement---would allow one to _judge_, or take it, that X where, or in, not doubting that things are as they look. There must already be a _that X_ in the way things thus look for there to be something to doubt or not.

The problem with this combination---a feature from one notion, a feature from the other---is that no visual look, nor any look in our first sense, _has_ any intrinsic import. Its presence _cannot_ mean as such that there is some way things should be to be the way they look _simpliciter_. The reasons for that have already been rehearsed. In brief, depending on exactly how one individuates such looks, either a given such look is the look of things being countless different rival ways---Pia approaching, her sister approaching, and so on---or it inevitably cohabits with the looks of things being those ways, where, again, there is nothing to choose from among these looks those which show how things should be to be the way they look _simpliciter_.

There is, and can be, no notion of look to serve McDowell’s purpose. It is the purpose that is at fault. McDowell’s bind here is just the representationalist’s. Looks that allowed us to appreciate that it was being represented to us as so that such-and-such would be identifiable as visual looks are, and not simply by what would be so if things were as they looked. If their mere presence fixed _how_ things were represented to us as being then, in doing that, they would fix a way things should be to be the way they look full stop. Such looks would combine features of our first and second notion. But those features do not combine. The representationalist, like McDowell, places an impossible set of demands on looks.
