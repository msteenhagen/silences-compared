# Looking as if

The second notion of looks is exhibited in the following remarks: ‘It looks like (as if, as though) Pia’s sister is approaching’, ‘It looks like (as if) Pia is going to sink that putt/has cut her hair’, ‘It looks as if this painting is a Vermeer (after all).’ Some expressions can be used either to express the first notion of looks or this second one. Some, though, express the second notion only. That is so of ‘looks like’ and ‘looks as if ’, with a proposition in the indicative as complement. ‘It looks as if this painting is a Vermeer’ thus contrasts both with ‘This painting looks like a Vermeer’, and with ‘It looks (almost, etc.) as though this painting were a Vermeer’ (or ‘This painting looks (uncannily) as though it were a Vermeer’. In general, there is a crucial contrast between ‘looks as if (indicative)’ and ‘looks as though (subjunctive)’. ‘Looks like a Vermeer’ may very well express the first notion of looks: it will be good enough if the painting is similar in looks to, resembles sufficiently, some Vermeer, or the way a Vermeer typically looks. But it also may express the second. ‘Looks as though (subjunctive)’ never expresses the second notion. I think it always expresses the first. So if van Meegeren delivers his latest masterpiece, which we know full well not to be a Vermeer, we may still say, admiringly, and truly, ‘It looks (uncannily) as though it were a Vermeer’, but _not_ ‘It looks as if it is a Vermeer.’ The first may be made true by the painting looking as it does---by it being much the same in looks as, or hard to distinguish from, a Vermeer. The second (‘looks as if (indicative)’) is never made true just by that, and is _not_ true where there is no reason to suppose the painting to _be_ a Vermeer.

I mean here to point to usage to distinguish two notions of looks. As between ‘looks as if ... is ...’ and ‘looks as though ... were ...’, one, I claim, is the exclusive province of the first, the other the exclusive province of the second.<sup>17</sup> The crucial point, though, is just that there are these two notions. If someone wants to use, say, ‘looks as if ... is ...’ to express what I claim is expressed only be ‘looks as though ... were ...’, it is not for me to dictate that he cannot. What matters is that we are conscious of the differences between these notions when it comes to asking just what notion of looks might serve a representationalist’s purpose.

It is the exclusive province of the visible to decide what demonstrable looks something has---to what exemplars it is visually akin. Something’s looking, in this sense, like a Vermeer, or a lemon, or a pig, need carry no suggestion that it is one. So nor is its having such a look in any way compromised by the absence of any such suggestion, or even by decisive indications to the contrary. The second notion---that for which ‘looks as if ’ (indicative) is reserved---is very much a matter of what can be gathered from, or what is suggested by, the facts at hand, or those visibly (audibly, etc.) on hand. So it cannot look as if _X_ on this notion where it is perfectly plain that _X_ is not so. Further, it looks as if _X_ only where one has not actually seen, or observed (for himself) that _X_ is so; in which case there would be nothing to gather.

On this second notion, if it looks as if Pia’s sister is approaching, or as if the painting is a Vermeer, then there is a way things should be, _simpliciter_, for things to be the way they thus look: Pia’s sister should be approaching; the painting should actually be a Vermeer. For all that, it may not be Pia’s sister approaching. It may be Pia’s sister, but retreating, or no one at all, mere light and shadows. In that case, _something_ is deceptive (whereas Pia looking, on the first notion, like her sister without being her does not yet make anything deceptive). It is perhaps just this feature of looks on this second notion that makes perception appear (to some) to represent things as so. But all depends here on what it is that is deceptive.

If perception represented things to us as thus and so, there would have to be, for any instance of it, a way things were according to it. Looks, on this second notion, where, or insofar as, there are any, identify something such a way _might_ be. So far, that is all to the good for the representationalist. They are not, on the other hand, something that might make content _available_. There is no particular demonstrable look present in, or by, things looking like/as if _X_ in this second sense. Things do that _wherever_ _X_ is how things should be to be the way they look. That is not a further fact made recognizable by things so looking. Nor, if the way things should be to be the way they look were the way they should be to be as represented, would looks in this sense be some perceptible cue to _that_ fact. If perception were representational, looks in this second sense might _be_ its representational content; but they could not be what made that content recognizable for us.

But for it to look as if such-and-such is so, on this notion, cannot be for it to be _represented_ to us, in perception, that that is so. That emerges in what one says in expressing the second notion. Let us begin with the third-person case. Suppose I say, ‘It looks to Sid as if the painting is a Vermeer’, or again, ‘as if Pia will win the tournament (will sink the putt)’. I thus credit Sid with a certain view of a certain matter. I say him to take it, perhaps tentatively, hesitantly, with some uncertainty, that, for example, Pia will win the tournament. (I will not speak correctly if Sid knows full well that Pia will win the tournament, or that the painting is a Vermeer. But it will be safe to waive that point here. I will not speak _truly_ if Sid does not think the painting is (even probably) a Vermeer, or etc.)

Suppose, now, that I say simply ‘It looks as if Pia will sink the putt’ (or whatever). To begin with, that is properly understood as (_inter alia_, perhaps) an expression of my own---perhaps tentative and hesitant---view of the matter: I think, or am inclined to think, going on the facts in hand, that she will sink it. I may have done no more than say how things thus seem to me; in which case I could have spoken more explicitly by saying ‘It looks _to me_ as if Pia will sink the putt.’ Here speaking of looks indicates explicitly that I am going by what I take it can be gathered from the facts in hand, or from things looking as they do. (Thus my view is about what I have not actually observed.)

But there may be more to an ‘It looks as if _P_’ than that. If I say, ‘It looks as if this car has been repainted’, I may be saying that, again going by the looks---by what is observable, or perhaps more generally, by all the facts in hand---_one can conclude_ with some, though perhaps not complete, certainty, that the car has been repainted. That, according to me, is what the looks, or the facts in hand, indicate. I am mistaken if they do not indicate that: I mistake a bit of undercoat for the original colour, say. Whether I am right or wrong depends on what things (factively) mean (or ought to)---a crucial feature of this second notion.

It may look to Sid as if the painting is a Vermeer when, in fact, it does not at all look as if it is a Vermeer; it has all the characteristics of a van Meegeren---a subject matter and style of dress, say, never found in Vermeer. There are observer-independent facts as to what looks to be the case, however occasion-sensitive a matter it is what counts as such a fact. When would a painting not, in fact, look like a Vermeer? When, for example, the woman sweeping the courtyard is using a type of broom not made until the 18th century, or is wearing a hat never worn in Holland; or when the brush strokes are a bit too broad to be Vermeer’s, or feather in the wrong way, or the pigments are a bit off. When does it not look as if Pia will sink the putt? When, for example, the ball is on a straight course for the hole, where it would have to be off to the right to catch the roll nearer the cup. When would it not look as if there are fresh roses in the vase? When, for example, the petals (if you look closely) are a bit too waxy to be real; or, again, when one is in an artificial flower shop. When would it not look as if Pia (marked as she is) had been in a fight? When, for example, her dog often drags her through brambles, so that you cannot tell by looking whether she has been in a fight or not.

We are now on familiar ground. The thing about the broom is that it _means_ (factively) that the painting was not done by Vermeer. Or if, unaccountably, Vermeer painted such a broom, then, though it does not mean that, one might have expected it to. Conversely, if, on inspection, the looks (first notion) really are distinctively the looks of a Vermeer---if that is the way he painted---then that _indicates_ that it is a Vermeer. In which case, on this second use of ‘look’, it looks, so far, like (as if) it is a Vermeer. One may so conclude. Again, the course of the ball means that it will catch the lie wrong, and hence miss the cup. If it does not miss---there is a freak guest of wind, or the earth moves---then, though that course did not mean that she would miss, one might rightly have expected so.

What things look like on this use of ‘looks’ is thus a matter of what things mean factively, or indicate; of how the world is contingently arranged. That is precisely not a matter of things being represented as so. Representation simply does not work that way. Whether it was represented to us as so that Pia will sink the putt is never a matter of whether her sinking it was indicated. Nor, by contrast with factive meaning, can it be decided by whether she did in fact sink it---if not, then, _ipso facto_, no such thing was represented as so.

So we have two notions of looks, neither of which allows looks to decide what was _represented_ as so. Things looking (first notion) as they do fixes no way things should be to be the way they look full stop; nor, a fortiori, to be as represented.<sup>18</sup> There is just too much things look like (first notion) in having the demonstrable looks they do. It/things looking like/as if what it does/they do (second notion) fixes a way things should be to be the way they look full stop. But to take that to fix what was _represented_ as so would collapse representation into indicating, or factive meaning, and thus to lose it altogether.

Neither notion suits the representationalist. He might thus seek a third. Both the temptation and its execution are visible in McDowell’s effort to explain a notion of ‘ostensibly seeing’. Ostensibly seeing is to be either of two cases. One disjunct is simply seeing something to be so---say, there to be a pig before one. One has the pig manifestly in view. In terms McDowell favours, its presence stands revealed. The other disjunct is a class of ringers for the first. It is not obvious just which class McDowell means to capture. In any case, he appeals to _some_ notion of looks for doing so. As he explains things,

- Ostensible seeings are experiences in which it looks to their subject as if things are a certain way

He then says this about the relevant notion of looks:

- Even if one does judge that things are as they look, having them look that way to one is not the same as judging that they are that way. In some cases, perhaps, one does judge that things are a certain way when they look that way. But ... unless there are grounds for suspicion, such as odd lighting conditions, having it look to one as if things are a certain way---ostensibly seeing things to be that way---_becomes_ accepting that things are that way by a sort of default. (McDowell 1998, pp. 438–9, italics mine)

McDowell clearly cannot mean ‘looks as if (indicative)’ in its normal English sense. So read, for it to look to one as if _X_ is for one to take it that _X_; for one’s mind to be made up. It is not to keep the option of accepting, or rejecting, ‘at face value’, that things are that way. Nor is it to be in a condition that may _evolve_ into judgement. It _is_ to judge. This fits with the first disjunct of what McDowell means to capture. Where I see the pig to be before me, my mind _is_ made up. Nothing remains (on that score) for me to take at face value or not. The world has already drawn credence from me. To see that such-and-such is so is to take it to be so.

So reading it may not fit well with what McDowell means to capture in the other disjunct. What unites the ringers in the cases where it looks to me as if there is a pig before me is nothing other than the fact that I so take it---that I am, thus, fooled. No demonstrable look, for example, is present in all these cases. There need not even be any such thing as a demonstrable look in every such case---certainly not a porcine one. This class would not be the same as the class in which things look as they would were there a pig before me (however exactly one identifies that class). What all its members would share in common with all instances of the first disjunct is only a bit of autorepresentation, not a visual likeness. Looking as if _X_ is meant to be a feature shared by all instances of either disjunct. But autorepresentation is implausibly the right feature.

It is clear to some extent what notion McDowell wants. First, it should be possible, on it, for it to look (to _N_) as if X, while, for all that, _not_ _X_ (so that there may be a face value). Second, it should be possible for it to look to _N_ as if _X_, on this notion, even when _N_ is entirely agnostic as to whether _X_ (so that looks may be taken or left at face value). So, too, it should be possible for it to look as if _X_, on the notion, even though _X_ is not to be concluded, even tentatively, from---is not indicated at all by---the facts in hand, or placed by the experience in hand. It looks as if it is a Vermeer; we _know_ it is a van Meegeren.

The relevant sense must make this attitude coherent; ‘That, anyway, is how things look (to me); as to what there is reason to think, that is quite another matter.’ For that, the way things (first sense) look (to _N_)---what is fixed by their demonstrable looks, so viewed---must fix how, in the relevant sense, they look to _N_.

There is nothing wrong with a notion that works in that way. Though there are ordinary means of expressing it, McDowell may choose whatever means he likes. It is the next step that makes everything go wrong. For McDowell also wants a look in his sense to carry as such a given import: for it to be present is, as such, for such-and-such thereby (at least) to be suggested; so for there to be a way things should be to be the way they look full stop. Only then could there be such a thing as judging (all the more refusing to judge) that things are as they look. Only then could there be any such thing to judge; such a thing as things being, or not, as they look.

This feature of McDowell’s notion makes looking in his sense contrast with having a demonstrable look. A demonstrable look, like any other visible thing, may sometimes indicate something. But that is a contingent matter. A porcine look sometimes indicates a pig, but need not. All that demonstrable looks fix as to how things look fixes _no_ particular way things should be to be the way they look full stop. (Nor would it fix what _representation_ requires by fixing what is indicated.) But, in meeting the first desideratum, what is thus fixed _would_ fix how things look to _N_ in McDowell’s sense. So how things look to _N_ in that sense cannot fix what way things should be to be the way they look. The two desiderata cannot consistently be fulfilled by _any_ notion of looks.

McDowell wants to mix two immiscible notions. Looking as if _X_ is to be what unites the two disjuncts of McDowell’s ‘ostensibly seeing’. It is to be what is in common to a pig being visibly before me, and the relevant cases of the mere appearance of that. For that he needs a look in his sense to be identified (as present or absent in any given case) as looks in our first sense are: there will be a ringer wherever things (as seen by me) look suitably as they would were there a pig before me. Just so is the occurrence of a ringer independent of what is indicated by, or what I make of, things (as viewed by me) looking as they do. Just that holds looks in his sense apart both from autorepresentation and from indicating. McDowell must draw on our first notion of a look to block that collapse. Such looks are just what _is_ independent of indicating, and of autorepresentation.

McDowell thus needs looks in our first sense, so demonstrable looks, to have intrinsic import: for such a look to make, _per se_, for a way things should be to be the way they look full stop. Only that would give an appearance the right shape to evolve into a judgement---would allow one to _judge_, or take it, that _X_ where, or in, not doubting that things are as they look. There must already be a _that_ _X_ in the way things thus look for there to be something to doubt or not.

The problem with this combination---a feature from one notion, a feature from the other---is that no demonstrable look, nor any look in our first sense, _has_ any intrinsic import. Its presence _cannot_ mean as such that there is some way things should be to be the way they look _simpliciter_. The reasons for that have already been rehearsed. In brief, depending on exactly how one individuates such looks, either a given such look is the look of things being countless different rival ways---Pia approaching, her sister approaching, and so on---or it inevitably cohabits with the looks of things being those ways, where, again, there is nothing to choose from among these those looks which show how things should be to be the way they look _simpliciter_.

There is, and can be, no notion of look to serve McDowell’s purpose. It is the purpose that is at fault. McDowell’s bind here is just the representationalist’s. Looks that allowed us to appreciate that it was being represented to us as so that such-and-such would be identifiable as demonstrable looks are, and not simply by what would be so if things were as they looked. If their mere presence fixed _how_ things were represented to us as being then, in doing that, they would fix a way things should be to be the way they look full stop. Such looks would combine features of our first and second notion. But those features do not combine. The representationalist, like McDowell, places an impossible set of demands on looks.
