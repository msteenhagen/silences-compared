# The position
The view at issue is advanced by such philosophers as Martin Davies, Christopher Peacocke, sometimes, of late, John McDowell; also by Gilbert Harman, John Searle, Michael Tye, and Colin McGinn, among many others.<sup>2</sup>

Martin Davies expresses it as follows:

- A subject’s experiences represent the world to her as being a certain way. These experiences may be correct or incorrect ... In short, experiences have representational or semantic properties; they have content. (Davies 1992, p. 22.)

Christopher Peacocke expresses it en passant as follows:

- A perceptual experience represents the world as being a certain way. What is
the nature of the content it represents as holding? (Peacocke 1992, p. 61)

He later insists that it is crucial to distinguish ‘perceptual experiences’

- from states that do not represent the world as being a certain way to the subject. (Peacocke 1992, p. 66)

The following four elements in the position will be in play here. All, I think, are non-controversially part of it. One aspect of the last, though, will emerge as optional. Nor, it will also then emerge, does present criticism turn on it.

##### 1. The representing in question is representing such-and-such as so

‘Represent’, and ‘representation’, have many uses. To represent may be to be an effect or trace of something. A ring on a tree trunk represents a year’s growth. Its width may also represent the drought of 1923. Again, to represent may be, in various ways, to be a stand-in, or substitute, for what is represented. A bit of plastic may represent an infantry division in a game of strategy. A squiggle on a map may represent the Lot. None of these uses of ‘represent’ is relevant to the present case. The point about perceptual experience is to be that there is a way things are according to it, that it represents things as being thus and so---where, for all that, things need not be that way. So representationalists tell us. If certain neural states, say, represent certain distal stimuli in being their effects or traces, or those yielding our awareness of them, that would not be to the present point. It would not amount to _their_ representing anything as so; as if that were something they might do without its being so. For if for them to represent involves their being traces, then where there is no such thing for them to be traces of, they simply do not represent that. (If, through some fluke, a tree gains two rings in one year, then a ring does not always represent a year’s growth. It is not that a certain ring represents something---say, that there was one more year of growth---but falsely.)<sup>3</sup> Similarly for the other cases here.

##### 2. Perceptual experience has a face value

That idea is in Davies:

- An experience may present the world to the subject as containing something square in front of her, and the subject may take that experience at face value and judge that there is something square in front of her. (Davies 1992, p. 23)

McDowell also proposes it:

- Minimally, it must be possible to decide whether or not to judge that things are as one’s experience represents them to be. How one’s experience represents things to be is not under one’s control, but it is up to one whether one accepts the appearance or rejects it. (McDowell 1994, p. 11)

- _That things are thus and so_ is the content of the experience, and it can also be the content of a judgment. It becomes the content of a judgment if the subject decides to take the experience at face value. (McDowell 1994, p. 26)

The idea is that any perceptual experience has a face value, at which the perceiver may take, or refuse to take, it. To take an experience at face value is to take it that such-and-such is so (in the case of perception, that one’s surroundings are thus and so). So the face value of an experience is that such-and-such is so. This just repeats point 1.

Where the face value of an experience is that things are thus and so, for all that things may, or may not, be that way. This just makes explicit a feature of representing things as so. Whatever does that _ipso facto_ admits of correctness, or incorrectness, according as things are, or not, as represented---in present idiom, as one would take it in taking it at face value. Such correctness is what truth requires. So any such thing is truth-evaluable. If ‘true’ is not colloquial here, we might substitute the word _‘veridical’_.

A second feature of face value is that whatever gives an experience its face value, and whatever makes that value recognizable, might be present in an experience, and in _that_ one, even if what, at that face value, is so in fact is not. So, for example, where the face value of an experience is that there is (visibly) a pig before one, what gives it that face value cannot be the presence of a pig. Nor can it be one’s seeing that.

That ties in with a third point on which McDowell, for one, insists. The face value of an experience is, again, something the experiencer can accept or reject, believe or disbelieve. So I must be able to see my experience to have such-and-such face value---that P---without yet taking it that P. So whatever I recognize in grasping its face value must be something that could be present even if not P; recognizing merely _that_ need not be to recognize P. (So if the face value is that there is a pig, what I grasp in grasping that fact cannot be that there is a pig.)

##### Discussion
McDowell speaks as if an experience’s face value is a matter of how things appear, or what, or how, they appear to be. (To accept an experience at face value is to ‘accept the appearance’---to take things to be as they appear.) Two preliminary points about that. First, we certainly do sometimes speak of things not being what they appear to be, or as, or what, they seem. Sid and Pia appear to be trysting; but they are only conspiring to throw a surprise party for Luc. The right explanation may make a host of small actions and signs look entirely different. But, as I will show in the next section, at least in a wide swathe of central cases, where things may be or not as they appear, their appearing as they do is an utterly different and distinct phenomenon from anything being represented as so. Second, though we are often enough confronted with appearances, that is not yet to say that the appearances, on a given occasion, add up to such a thing as ‘the way things (then) appear to be’. It is a large assumption that there is, in general, such a thing as _the_ way things appear to be. (For one thing, appearances are certainly not always a matter of things appearing _to be_ some way at all.)

##### 3. Being represented to is not autorepresentation

To take things to be thus and so just is to represent them to oneself as that way. Such representing is _all_ in the attitude. It does not consist in producing, nor in awareness of, something which represents things as that way, and which one can, or does, then take as doing that. Merely that would fall short of taking things to _be_ as represented. Nor is it any part of what thus representing things to oneself is. I will call representing something to oneself as so _autorepresentation_.<sup>4</sup>

Autorepresentation contrasts with another phenomenon which is also representing things as a certain way. Perhaps that is a way things either are or are not, in which case the representation may be held true or false accordingly. Representing in this way does mean producing, or arranging for, or simply being, something which represents things as a certain way, and which is so to be taken. I will call this second form of representation _allorepresentation_.

In a central case, allorepresentation represents such-and-such as _so_. To see such a representation for what it is is to have it on _some_ authority, however poor, that things _are_ as represented. I will call this _committed_ representation. It is such representation that can be accepted or rejected.

Perhaps there is a second case. Suppose one thinks of an English sentence, as such, as true or false. (One _need_ not think that merely in thinking of a sentence as representing things as a certain way; but will if one thinks of that way as one things (_ceteris paribus_) are or are not.) An English sentence is not in any way committed to things being some one way rather than another. _It_ does not pretend, or purport, that that is how things are. If one understands the English sentence ‘Pigs swim’ one thereby has it on no authority at all that that is how things are. It would be a gross misunderstanding to see _English_ as thus saddled with such a preposterous collection of contradictory commitments. So, perhaps, there is such a thing as uncommitted allorepresentation. Following Frege, one might find such representation in embedded propositions, ‘mock speech’, and, perhaps, elsewhere.

In the cases that make the idea of uncommitted allorepresentation plausible, uncommitted representations always have committed counterparts. The same representational means—the same ways of making representational content recognizable---which may yield an uncommitted representation may also yield a committed one. There is the English sentence ‘Pigs swim’, which _may_ be used for stating that pigs swim. What may be embedded, or mock-spoken, may also occur as an assertion.

Only where there is committed representation can one be represented to. Only then can one have it on any authority that things are thus and so. Only committed representation can have a face value. With uncommitted representation, there is nothing either to accept or reject; nothing purportedly so. One cannot take the English sentence ‘Pigs swim’ at face value. It has none. But it will make no difference to present arguments whether the representation that occurs in perception is committed or not.

The main point is now this. If we are represented to in perception, that cannot be autorepresentation. Further, it must be allorepresentation. For one thing, perception is, if anything, a source of information as to how things are in our surroundings. Autorepresentation is not a _source_ of information at all. It _registers_, or presumes to. For another, our current autorepresenting does not leave us any option of taking it at face value or refusing to. To autorepresent something just is to accept it. Things will not count as having been represented to me as so merely because I autorepresent them, that is, take them to be so. _This_ passive does not work that way.

Committed allorepresentation is a source of reasons of a certain distinctive sort for thinking things: a reason for thinking that things are thus and so _may_ be that they were represented to one as that way. Current autorepresentation is no source of reasons for one to think things. Past autorepresentation may be. That I used to think that pigs swim may indicate that they do. Perhaps I used to know about such things. Uncommitted allorepresentation as such gives no reason for thinking things. The _occurrence_, or instancing, of a certain uncommitted allorepresentation at a certain time and place may give a reason for thinking something. For, like any other occurrence, it may _mean_ something. The reason it gives will thus be of just the same sort as the reason those bald patches on the cat give for thinking it has mange.

##### 4. The relevant representing must be recognizable by us

If we are going to be represented _to_ in experience, then the relevant representing must be something we can appreciate for what it thus is. If, in a perceptual experience, things are represented to us as being thus and so, then we must be able to appreciate the experience as representing as so what it thus does; to appreciate what it is that is thus so according to it. That need not mean that we can characterize such representational content accurately, or formulate it explicitly. But we should be able to recognize, where needed, of particular ways things may or may not be, whether that is what the experience represented to us as so---whether that is what one would take to be so in taking the experience at face value---whether, for example, the experience is one according to which a certain stick is bent, or rather one according to which that stick is straight. The core idea is: you cannot represent things to people as so in a way they simply cannot recognize as doing that.

I am going to suppose, for working purposes, that what would make the representational content of experience recognizable to the perceiver---_if_ experience represented anything as so---would be, in some sense or other, the way things then look, or appear, or, again, their looking, or appearing, as they do. So, in some sense of ‘looks’ or ‘appears’, if things look, or appear, as they do on a given occasion, that should leave exactly one representational content for _that_ particular experience to have. On that occasion, at least, a different content would have required things to look, or appear, different.

The relevant sense of ‘looks’, or ‘appears’, can be negotiated later. In fact, the representationalist can have more or less free choice. But I take it that it would be cheating if, say, ‘looks like things are thus and so’ turned out just to _mean_ ‘things are represented to the perceiver as being thus and so’. Looks in that sense might _be_ representational content; but they could not be that by which an experience is recognizable as having the representational content that it does.

The idea here is that one could tell the representational content of an experience by the way, in it, things looked. I will call such content _looks-indexed_. I will, _pro tem_ only, take this to be part of the view in question, and, accordingly, use it. Eventually, I will be able to do without it, with no loss of results.

To sum up, then, the position on which in perception we are represented to, as I will construe it here, has four significant points.

1. The representation in question consists in representing things as so (thus, truly/veridically, or falsely/non-veridically).
2. It has, or gives perceptual experience, a face value, at which it can be taken or declined (or discounted).
3. It is not autorepresentation. (It is allorepresentation, though here, not crucially.)
4. Where we are thus represented to, we can recognize that, and how, this is so; most pertinently, we can appreciate what it is that is thus represented to us as so. Provisionally, I suppose it is (in some sense) the way things look that lets us do that.
