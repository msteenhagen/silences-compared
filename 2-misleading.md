# Misleading

By perceiving I can learn things. Walking through a park near Lisbon, my nose tells me, and my eyes confirm, that there are eucalyptus. Seeing Luc and Pia touch hands at dinner makes all the pieces fall into place. By perceiving I can also be misled, at least because what I see (hear, feel, smell) may be misleading. A touch need not mean what it seemed to. An odour may be artificially produced. For _what_ I perceive to be misleading, nothing need be _represented_ as so. Perhaps _none_ of the ways perception may mislead involves anything being represented to us as so. Perhaps in perception things are _not_ represented to us as being thus and so. That was Austin’s view. He put it this way:

- Though the phrase ‘deceived by our senses’ is a common metaphor, it _is_ a metaphor; and this is worth noting, for in what follows [in Ayer] the same metaphor is frequently taken up by the expression ‘veridical’ and taken very seriously. In fact, of course, our senses are dumb---though Descartes and others speak of ‘the testimony of the senses’, our senses do not _tell_ us anything, true or false. (Austin 1962: p. 11)

Austin’s idea is that, rather than _representing_ anything as so, our senses merely bring our surroundings into view; afford us some sort of awareness of them. It is then for us to make of what is in our view what we can, or do. Austin speaks as if he is taking issue with Descartes. There are, indeed, large differences between Austin and Descartes as to what it is we can see. (One main thing Austin saw and Descartes missed is, to label it, occasion-sensitivity, here---notably, the sensitivity to occasions for the counting, of what someone counts as having seen in some episode of viewing, and what awareness is mediated by the _visual_ awareness he thus enjoys.) Prescinding from such issues, the two are allies on this particular point. Over a wider area which includes perception, Descartes said this:

- By the mere intellect I do no more than perceive the ideas that are matters for judgement; and precisely so regarded the intellect contains, properly speaking, no error. (Descartes 1954: p. 95, Fourth Meditation)

- Whence, then, do my errors originate? Surely just from this: my will extends more widely than my understanding, and yet I do not restrain it within the same bounds, but apply it to what I do not understand. (Descartes 1954: pp. 96–7)

Sensory experience is, for Descartes, one more case where I am simply confronted with ‘ideas’. I cannot be confronted correctly or incorrectly, veridically or deceptively. I simply confront what is there. Perception leads me astray only where I _judge_ erroneously, failing to make out what I confront for what it is. The possibility of error thus arises with, and only with, autorepresentation. If that is the only point at which such possibility arises, then there is no room for allorepresentation in perception; no place other than autorepresentation for what is liable to be veridical or not.

Part of the point here is that perception is, first and foremost, a source of _unmediated_ awareness. I will call awareness of X _mediated_ if it is hostage to awareness of something else: that further awareness is part of what entitles one to take it that X is so, or present; so part of what qualifies one as aware of that. In unmediated awareness, one’s entitlement to take it that X is hostage to no more than some form of awareness of X itself (such as seeing it). Seeing your car in the [(p.31) ]()drive makes me aware that you are home. That is mediated awareness that you are home; unmediated awareness that your car is in the drive.

Another part of the point is that _perception_, as such, simply places our surroundings in view; affords us awareness of them. There is no commitment to their _being_ one way or another. It confronts us with what is there, so that, by attending, noting, recognizing, and otherwise exercizing what capacities we have, _we_ may, in some respect or other, make out what is there for what it is---or, again, fail to. It makes us aware, to some extent, of things (around us) being as they are. It is then up to us to make out, or try to, which particular ways that is. Perception cannot present things as being other than they are. It cannot present some way things are _not_ as what is so. That would not be mere confrontation. So it cannot represent anything as so. Representing, by nature, is liable to be of what is not so.

Such is a view, and, so far, only that. On it, in perception things are _not_ presented, or represented, to us as being thus and so. They are just presented to us, full stop. It is in making out, or trying to, what it is that we confront that we _take_ things, rightly or wrongly, to be thus and so. Autorepresentation is the only representation in perceptual experience as such. Austin and the representationalist are thus at odds. The question who is right remains thus far open. The immediate point is that _misleading_ perceptual experiences do not count in the representationalist’s favour.

Perceptual experience _may_ be misleading. Things may not be what they seem, or what they appear to be. On Austin’s view, it is _what_ is perceived, or experienced---what is actually presented to us---that may thus mislead. The form of misleading that is thus central is modelled in the following. Sid shows up for dinner drunk. That much we can all see. That he is drunk (at this hour) may mean that it will be a long and boring evening. Or, again, it may mean that, once again, he has lost his job. If it does mean that, then from what we see---that he is drunk---we may gain mediated awareness of those further facts. So far, perception is informative, not misleading.

What we see, hear, and so on, may be informative because it bears factive meaning. Factive meaning is, crucially, something utterly different from representation. The most obvious point is this: if A factively means B, then if (_since_) A, B. If Sid did not lose his job, then his drunkenness does not mean that. By contrast, if B is not so, that is no bar to something having represented it as so. Just this makes room for representing falsely, so for _any_ representing things to be so.

There is a subtler, and at least equally important, difference. Suppose that there are various things one might understand by someone’s being fired. On one understanding, but not another, perhaps, being riffed (‘downsized’) is being[ ]()fired. Suppose that, on some understanding of being fired, Sid’s drunkenness factively means that he was fired. On what understanding? That question is answered purely by how the world is, in fact, arranged. Just what would make Sid get drunk (at such an early hour)? By contrast, suppose Pia informs us that Sid has been fired. On what understanding of being fired has she thus represented this as so? That question is not answered by looking to the world. It is not a question of what, in Sid’s history, would cause thus and so. It is rather a question of what Pia has committed herself to---that is, of for what she is rightly held responsible; of what ought to be expected of her by virtue of her representing as she did.

The contrast between factive meaning and representation also shows up in the structure of reasons. That A factively means B, once recognized, makes A proof of B. That B was represented as so leaves it open how good the reason is for thinking B. For all that, the issue may or may not be settled.

Misleading is not yet in the picture. To put it there, suppose that Sid is drunk, but was not fired. Then, perhaps, things are not what they appeared to be. Our experience may thus have been misleading. What would make it misleading is just this: given the way Sid is, one might have expected his drunkenness to mean that he was fired; such was to be expected. Similarly, seeing Luc and Pia’s flat strewn with broken crockery, one might reasonably suppose there to have been a tiff. For all that, there may not have been one. Too much champagne at brunch may have led to an excess of exuberance. Where A might reasonably, or rightly, be expected factively to mean B, I will say that A indicates B. Indicating is no more representing something as so than factively meaning is. What one may expect things to mean depends as much as what they in fact mean on how world is arranged---here, on what _as a rule_ co-occurs with what (though the relevant rule may vary with one’s cognitive position).

A, in indicating B, may be misleading just by virtue of what it might have been expected to mean. What one _might_ have expected might fail to be so. (Leaving work, Sid happened onto a vodka-tasting which, atypically, he failed to resist.) So something we perceive, or experience, may indicate what is not so. What it indicates is what there is reason to think, even when it is not, in fact, so. That is _one_ way perceptual experience may be misleading, other than by representing something as so.

Our perceiving what means, or indicates, something is not the only way for perceptual experience to be informative. Meaning and indicating provide avenues of mediated awareness. Unmediated awareness may also be informative. There is such a thing as learning that there is a pig before one by seeing it. One might think that meaning and indicating similarly fail to exhaust the ways for perceptual experience to be misleading, or to misinform. But there is no parallel. Unmediated awareness is a way of being informed; not one of being misinformed, nor a further way to be misled. That there _is_ such a thing is precisely no reason to think that perceptual experience is not only of what means or indicates, but also what _represents_ things to be so.

It may be the pig’s presence that makes me aware that there is a pig before me, thanks to my _seeing_ it. I do not then _erroneously_ take it to be there. If there is a pig to do any misleading, then that is one score on which I am not misled. Equally for my seeing one. If I am misled into taking a pig to be before me when there is none, I am misled by something else. The rear half of a pig, protruding from behind the barn, might do that if there is only a rear half there (perhaps mechanically animated). It _would_ do so if I took it to mean there was a whole pig, thus inferring what, even if indicated, was not so. (If it is not just a rear half, perhaps one sees a _pig_, rear view.) Indications of a pig, or what I take for such, may lead me to conclusions. That is not for them, or anything, to _represent_ something to me as so.

So far, there are no signs of something in perception to mislead other than by being taken to indicate what is not so. There are thus no signs yet that we are ever misled by, or in, having something _represented_ to us as so. Visual illusions have been alleged to do this. Here is McDowell on that point:

- In the Müller-Lyer illusion, one’s experience represents the two lines as being unequally long, but someone in the know will refrain from judging that that is how things are. (McDowell 1994: p. 11, footnote)

But is this so? In the Müller-Lyer, two lines are contrived (by means of accompanying wedges) to have a certain look. They do not just _seem_ to have that look; they actually so look (as the illusion’s robustness testifies). Two lines may well have that look because one _is_ longer than the other. That is a familiar way for things to be. Depending on circumstances, that look may thus _indicate_ that it is two lines of unequal length that one confronts. Or one might take it to. Unequal length _might_ be what is to be expected; or at least what _is_expected. _Thus_ may someone be misled by a Müller-Lyer. False expectations arise here in the wrong view of what something (a look) means, though perhaps a right view of what it _ought_ to. What one gets wrong is the arrangement of the world: how the misleading seen thing in fact relates to other things. That mistake neither requires, nor suggests, that in this illusion one line is represented to us as being longer than the other, or that anything else is represented as so.

The phenomena of misleading experience do not suggest that in experience things are represented to us as so. That is no proof that they are not. We must examine that idea more closely.
