# Visual Appearance

If in perceptual experience things are represented to us as being so, that will be distinct from, and in addition to, things being indicated, or factively meant, by one or another thing we see (hear, and so on). It will be an additional way to be aware of our surroundings, giving different sorts of reasons for thinking things. If not-P, then _nothing_ factively meant that P; though not-P cannot, by itself, rule out its having been represented as so that P. As for indicating, if P is to be expected, that is _per se_ reason to think that P, whereas if P was _represented_ as so, that may or may not be reason to think so, depending on the value of that representing. (Representation yields only mediated awareness of what it represents as so, though for the moment I will not press that point.) Being represented to in perception would also be utterly distinct from the autorepresentation that goes with making out, or noting, _what_ one perceives. Does perception make room for such a further phenomenon? This section begins a case that it does not.

Someone to whom, in perceptual experience, things can be represented as so is someone who can take, and treat, his perceptual experiences as having the representational content they do; who can see, appreciate, what it is that is so according to them. If perception is representational, then we philosophers are, presumably, in that position. So where there is a question as to whether such-and-such is or is not so according to such-and-such experience, or was, or was not, represented as so in that experience, that is a question the answer to which should be, at least as a rule, or often, intuitively, or tolerably, clear, to us, among others---at least on suitable reflection.

One idea would be that it is looks-indexing that makes such facts available to us: the representational content of an experience can be read off of the way, in it, things looked. I will begin to examine that idea by distinguishing, and exploring, two different notions of looks. Neither, I will show, makes room for it. On the first, looks are something fit genuinely to make representational content recognizable. But they do not decide any particular representational content for any given experience to have. On the second, looks are not what might make content available to us. The most they might do would just be to _be_ that content, In fact, though, they are a matter, not of representing, but rather of what is indicated. They do not point to any phenomenon in perception beyond that. Many expressions which speak of looks---though not all---_can_ be used to express either notion. I will thus distinguish the notions simply in terms of when, on each, things would look thus and so. (There are, though, expressions reserved for the second notion only.)

On the first notion, something looks thus-and-so, or like such-and-such, where it looks the way such-and-such, or things which are (were) thus and so, does (would, might) look. (Caveat: Pia may look like her sister on a bad day, or so look in this light, or to Sid, without looking like her sister.) On this notion, Pia may look (rather, very much, exactly) like (the spitting image of) her sister. That man on the bench looks old. (He looks the way an old man would, or might.) The shirt looks blue (in this light)---as a blue shirt (so viewed) does, or might. The sun, at sunset, may look red. A van Meegeren may look (uncannily) like a Vermeer. A copy of a Vermeer, made by an amateur in the museum, may look (just like) the original. Or, perhaps, it may turn out looking more like a van Meegeren. Pia, having been dragged through the brambles by her dog, may look as though she had been in a fight. That is how one may well have looked had one been in a fight.

Pia looks like her sister. They resemble each other. For _that_ to be true is not yet for either to look any particular way. But if she looks like her sister, there is a look, or are looks, both share. Pia _has_ these looks, simply in looking as she does. Such a look may be identified by an exemplar---her sister, or, perhaps, herself. Given the example, what remains to be understood is in what way something must be like it in _visual_ appearance for _that_thing’s looking as it does to be another exemplar of the look in question. Whether something has the look is settled simply by its visual effect. It has the look, perhaps, only under given conditions for producing that effect---only when viewed _thus_ (such as from a certain angle). The look may be detectable only by one with suitable visual equipment. But to have the look (viewed _thus_) is to have it _full stop_---independent of how its so looking bears on whether to take it to _be_ any given thing it thus looks _like_. I will call looks on this understanding of a look _visual looks_, or, sometimes, because of the way they are fixed by exemplars, _visible_ looks.

If Pia looks like her sister, there is a way she should be to be what she _thus_ looks like: she should be her sister. If Pia’s imitation of her sister nonplussed looks uncannily like her sister nonplussed, then, again, there is a way things should be to be what they _thus_ look like: it should be her sister, nonplussed. How things should be to be the way they look, full stop, is another matter. Pia’s looking even exactly like her sister does not yet mean that whenever one see _Pia_, things are not the way they look. Otherwise, _no_ experience of seeing Pia, and, by parity, none of seeing her sister, would be one in which things were the way they looked. Seeing Pia, or her sister, to be present could _never_ be taking experience at face value. No experience of seeing either one could be veridical. So it cannot be that what is required for Pia being what she looks like in looking like her sister is what is required for things being as they look where she is present, or where one sees her, full stop. The simple point is: how things should be to be the way they look (on a given occasion, or in a given experience) is not decided by how things should be to be the way they look in such-and-such looking thus and so. There are already intimations of why it cannot be so decided.

If perception is representational, then, for any perceptual experience, there must be a way things are according to it. If such content is looks-indexed, then things looking as they do on a given occasion must fix _what_representational content experience then has. Specific facts as to what things look like on this first notion of looks gain no purchase on what is thus required. How things must be to be what they _thus_ look like does not decide how things must be to be the way they look; so nor, by that route, any way they must be to be as they (supposedly) are according to an experience in which things did so look. It is still open, perhaps, that things looking as they do points to some representational content for an experience to have; things looking thus and so does not. That is the first simple point.

Which ways things looked on an occasion and what they then looked like, is, in general, an occasion-sensitive matter: these are questions whose (true) answers vary with the occasion for posing them. (See Travis 2008 for more on occasion sensitivity.) For whether X looks like Y is very liable to depend on how comparisons are made. If Pia is blissfully asleep while her sister, bleary-eyed and insomniac, stares blankly at the flickering screen, they still look alike if you view the matter in one way, but not if you view it in another. Similarly, Pia will still look like Pia in ten year’s time---when the matter is viewed in one way, but, sadly, not when it is viewed in another. Again, in the case of the Müller-Lyer, the two lines look like two lines of unequal length if you view the matter in one way (ignoring the wedges), but not if you view it in another. Given this, how comparisons _are_to be made for assessing the truth of a particular claim that X looks like Y will vary with precisely what was said in making it. On an occasion for describing a given perceptual experience, there may be definite things one _would_ then say in saying X to look, or have looked, like Y---so, again, things one would not. But what one would say on some one such occasion does not decide, of that experience as such, how things looking as they then did relates to how things should be to be the way they then looked.

On an occasion for saying what, in an experience, things looked like, some comparisons may be natural, or right, or even possible, and others not. For all of what is thus sometimes so, in looking like Y, X also shares a look with many things. It looks as each of these does, or might, on some correct way of saying what things look like. If Pia looks like her sister, she also, on some understanding, looks the way she herself does, so might, or would, look. On some understanding or other, she looks (just) like any of indefinitely many different things. There is thus a substantial problem. Which facts as to Pia’s looking (like) thus and so matter, and how, to how things should be to be the way they look simpliciter? Which looks, if any, matter to what is thus represented as so? And how? And why?

Our initial simple point now deepens. One cannot move from the various _ways_ things should be to be the various _ways_ they look to the _way_ things should be to be the _way_ they look. For those various ways move in mutually exclusive directions: things could be some of them only in not being others. For looks to identify a content, one needs a principled way of ignoring some of the specific ways things look, and attending only to others. That would be a policy for fixing, in terms of looks, what is so according to an experience, so when it would be deceptive, non-veridical, or misleading in the sought-for further way. If representational content is looks-indexed, the question becomes when looks---the _way_ thinks look---would be deceptive, false, or misleading, so when a specific _way_ things look would contribute to making them so. That question, posed of given (experienced) looks as such, clearly has no answer.

Looks on this first notion might make representational content recognizable, even bear it, were there any. They are _visible_ features; not features of the content had (such as requiring such-and-such for truth). The trouble is that they are unfit to index content. For as to that they point in no one direction.

In looking like her sister Pia shares a look with countless other things---herself, a wax replica of herself in Madame Tussaud’s, a good hologram, a body double, an actress made up to play the role of her, a Pia-clone, and so on _ad infinitum_. For each of these, there is a way things should be to be what they _thus_ look like: Pia should be, respectively, herself, her sister, a wax dummy, a hologram, an actress, a clone, and so on. An experience that represented all that as so would be incoherent. Representation cannot fit into this picture unless something selects _which_ facts as to what Pia looks like bear on it. It is no part of what perception is---of how it opens our surroundings to our view---that in perceiving one is to appreciate one set of facts as to what things look like, and ignore others. Looks, on this first notion of them, are thus not a route by which we might be represented to in perception.

Seeing Pia on terrasse may make us think any of many things---one for each of the things she then looks like. What it makes us think depends on our current proclivities to think things. Believing Pia is in foreign climes may raise the odds that we will take her for her sister. But it can hardly be that what perception represents to us as so is a matter of what we are anyway prone to believe or conclude. If you represent Pia to me as in Greece, I cannot turn that into your representing her as in Athens merely by so concluding. For us to take Pia for her sister is for us to autorepresent. It is a matter of what we _think_ we see; of taking what we see for something else. Being represented to has no role in the aetiology of such mistakes. They involve nothing purporting falsely to inform. Nor can autorepresentation be conjured into being represented to.

What goes for Pia goes for peccaries. What goes for peccaries goes for something’s being blue. A peccary, confronted in the right way, may look exactly like a pig (or it may do to us novices). It also, of course, looks just the way a peccary might look (so confronted). It may also look like a tapir, a clever dummy pig, a wax imitation peccary, and so on. Experience cannot coherently represent it to us as both a peccary and wax (and a pig, and so on). Similarly, a shirt may look like a blue shirt. In looking as it does, it will also look the way a white shirt would when illuminated in certain ways, or when in certain conditions. It may also look like countless other things. Some such fact might index the representational content of things so looking. But only on condition that the other such facts do not. The problem now is: _what_ decides that it is some one such fact, and no other, which plays that role.

Suppose that, in looking blue, some shirt looks a way one can exhibit by exhibiting a certain colour---say, by holding up a blue paint chip. Is it, in that case, represented to us as being blue? It looks the way a blue shirt does, or might, illuminated in a certain way. But that is not decisive. We are not on the track of representation here unless there is (as there clearly is) such a thing as a shirt merely looking, but not actually being blue. Choose a way for that to happen. Perhaps the shirt has been dipped in rapidly disappearing ink. Perhaps (like certain sculptures) it constantly changes colour, depending on exact conditions of viewing. Or perhaps, up close, it is a pointilliste motley. Insofar as these are ways of failing to be blue, they provide us with further things the shirt looks like. It looks just the way some pointilliste motley would (viewed from a distance), and so on. So our problem rearises: which of these facts matter (and how) to what was represented to us as so?

The point generalizes. Take any way things may be said to look. Now take any way that things may fail to be what they would need to be to be what they _thus_ look like. That is _another_ way things may be said then to look: they look just the way they would if _that_, rather than the first thing, were the way things are. So this second way for things to be---for them not to be that first thing they may be said to look like---could, if it in fact obtained, make it the case that things were not the way they looked only if something decided that only the first thing things looked like, and not the second, mattered to things being as they looked full stop. By the same token, the obtaining of this second thing, or of anything else that made things fail to be that first thing, would make for misrepresentation in perception only if something decided that it was only the first fact about looks, and not the second, or any other such, that indexed representational content. Perception does not do such selecting for us.

The conclusion so far is that _on our first notion of looks_, looking like such-and-such cannot contribute to determining how things should be to be the way they look _simpliciter_. For, so far as it goes, there is no particular way things should be to be the way they look _simpliciter_. For that reason, things looking like such-and-such, or looking such-and-such ways, on this first notion of looks, cannot index anything as represented to us as being so.

A wax lemon may be so artfully done that it is only with great difficulty, if at all, that it can be told, by sight, from the real thing. For most purposes, it can thus be said to look (just like) a (real) lemon. It is enough for it to look that way that it is sufficiently similar in looks to the real thing; that there is a suitable visually decidable resemblance. The look in question is visual; shared by anything looking suitably the same way as an exemplar. Precisely because the look _is_ visual in this sense, it would be rash in general to conclude from something’s _thus_looking (just) like a lemon that it is one---unless one may suppose that, in the case at hand, such looks have a certain factive meaning. Nor, for that reason, can we conclude from the mere fact of the wax looking like a lemon in this sense that it should be one for _things_ to be the way they look. Its lemon-like look suggests no such thing. So the fact of its looking like a lemon does not help make it so that it is represented to us as being one.

We _do_ sometimes say, ‘It looks like it is a lemon’, the ‘it’ referring to the lemon, or functioning as dummy subject, where the item must be a lemon for _things_ to be the way they thus look. What that shows is that there is another notion of looking like. I turn to that notion next.
