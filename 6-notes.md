# Notes
1. The urge thus to transform ordinary questions as to what an experience was like may arise from a prior felt need to say what it was for an experience to have been the experience it was, without mentioning anything to be met with in experience whether then experienced or not. That is another urge worth fighting.
2. See, for example, Harman (1990), Searle (1983), for example, pp. 47–8, Tye (1995), especially Ch. 4, McGinn, (1991), pp. 29–30, and McGinn (1982).
3. Nothing in this makes it illegitimate for cognitive psychologists, in their accounts of the sub-personal processes involved in, say, vision, to speak of representations on which computations can be performed. My own view is that for such things to serve their explanatory ends, there is no need to see such representations as committed to anything being so (so as *mistaken* or not accordingly). They may simply represent, say, a colour-edge being at a certain position (without representing it as so that it actually is there). See the discussion of committed and uncommitted representation below.
4. This should be taken broadly. Taking something to be doubtfully, or possibly, so, or so on such-and-such condition, or a condition on which such-and-such is so, or an open question, are, so far as I am concerned, cases of taking something to be so. One may take something to be so hesitantly, speculatively, with some uncertainty, for the sake of argument, and so on. Autorepresentation thus accepts all these modifications. Imagining to oneself Frege in a plumed helmet might be representing Frege to oneself in a plumed helmet without taking anything to be *so*---certainly not that, say, he wore one. One could call that autorepresentation too, if one liked. But it is the straightforward cases of taking something to be so that will matter here.
5. It is time to acknowledge that the points I will make here against the representationalist view differ little, if at all, form points Austin makes in *Sense and Sensibilia* (Austin 1962), a remarkably rich work. Were Austin not so thoroughly ignored, perhaps I would not have written this.
6. The crucial difference can be put this way. For Descartes, if perception ever yields me mere mediated awareness of such-and-such---if, say, I ever need to judge, going on the looks, that it is a round tower in the distance, rather than simply seeing that it is---then it always yields me at best mediated awareness. Which reduces what I can strictly speaking see to what Descartes calls ‘ideas’. With Austin, occasion-sensitivity is firmly in the picture: what I can correctly be said actually to have seen depends on the occasion for *saying* what I see. That is the insight behind Austin’s insistence that there is no one sort of thing which is, invariably, the sort of thing one does see. It is *sometimes* right to say that it may be a square tower for all I can see; and hence, that I cannot see it to be round. That does not mean that, strictly speaking, I never see a tower to be round.
7. It is also, of course, a source of whatever further awareness proceeds from that.
8. Unmediated awareness may be of an object, or its presence, or of things, or a thing, being thus and so, or, again, of something being as it is in such-and-such respect (the bird’s head being coloured as it is, say). It is the last three cases that provide reasons for thinking things.
9. ‘Rif’: reductioninforce. A more current term is ‘downsize’.
10. There is, to be sure, occasion-sensitivity in what can be said truly as to what would be if. That is sensitivity in the particular way we appeal to the world on an occasion. For all that, it remains the world we thus appeal to.
11. This need not mean that I conclude from the rear half that there is a pig every time I view one from behind. Sometimes I may just see the pig.
12. ‘Looks like’ takes modifiers. Pia may look like her sister. She may also look like her sister, viewed from this angle, or in this light. Again, she may look like her sister to Sid (viewed from this angle, or in this light). Modification matters. Pia may look like her sister in this peculiar light, or to Sid, but not really look like her sister at all; again, look like her sister to Sid in this light without looking like her sister in this light at all. But all the points I will make about this notion survive any such modification. Pia, I will say, looks like her sister, among countless other things. If Sid is, say, bad at facial recognition, she may look like her sister to Sid, though she does not really look like that at all. But all the more will there be countless other things she looks like to Sid---Zoë, no doubt, for one. Looking like _X_ to _N_ takes account of particular (I think contextually fixed) ways in which things may look different to _N_ than they actually look---inebriation, fatigue, colour blindness, etc. But these ways do not change the fact that if _X_ looks like one thing to _N_, then it looks like countless things---on the notion of looks being set out here.
13. For it to look blue in this light is also for it to have, in this light, a certain look, where ‘blue’ is a way of saying what that look is: one exhibits the look by exhibiting that colour (whatever, on an occasion, might count as doing that). That will be equally irrelevant as the fact cited in the text to the question how things should be to be the way they look, full stop. But with that last remark I adumbrate.
14. This is one point of Austin’s example of saying what footballers look like from the top of the stadium. (_Sense and Sensibilia_, pp. 40–1.) For a further explanation of the notion of occasion sensitivity, see Travis 1997.
15. We speak of words, or sentences, as bearing (having) representational import: as representing, or contributing to representing, in particular ways. We could just as well find that import in (the fact of) particular sounds, or marks, having particular shapes---the (abstract) shapes one specifies in specifying the sentences of a language. So we could say, harmlessly, that it is their having those shapes that bears representational import. If it is looks, or appearances, that make the representational content of (in) perception available to us, then we could equally harmlessly speak of those looks---of things looking as they thus do---as being, so as bearers of, representational import. Representationalism, if otherwise in order, will not go wrong at _that_ point. But if representationalists choose not to speak that way, I need not take issue with that either.
16. The reader is to decide just what is to count as not (really) being blue. Any of these might sometimes count as a way of _being_ blue. All I need is that something counts as looking, but not really being, it.
17. So suppose that, in the lab, your are fitted with electrodes and given a perfect illusion of an orange before you (some would count that a perfect hallucination). Suppose that you know about the laboratory situation. Then, according to me, you might say, ‘It’s uncanny. It looks _exactly_ as though there were an orange before me’, but not, ‘It looks as if there is an orange before me (though I know full well that there is not).’ But present philosophy does not rest on this point of usage.
18. Certainly not that they _look_ that way (as they do), or those ways (the ways they do), or any one of those ways (or so look to us).
19. Harman does not speak explicitly of our being represented _to_. He does, though, endorse, fully, unequivocally, the idea that a perceptual experience has a face value, in our present sense. (See Harman 1990, p. 46.) That will do for our present purpose.
20. I may see a pig, where it looks nothing like one---where it is difficult,or impossible, to make out that it is a pig. Harman surely does not mean to count all such cases as ones of seeing✵ a pig. What cases does he mean? Perhaps just those in which the pig looks like one---has a certain demonstrable porcine look. Seeing✵ a pig would then just be seeing (something with) that look. But that is not what seeing a pig is. Nor could awareness of seeing that be seeing a pig to be there.
21. We do sometimes say, ‘She can plainly see that there are pigs about; yet she continues to deny it.’ I suggest that our complaint, where coherent, must be either that her denials cannot really be sincere (or involve massive self-deception); or else that, while she _ought_ to see that there are pigs about---they are so plainly in view---she, stupidly, misses their presence, has failed to notice them.
22. Pigs, excluding talking ones, do not represent anything as so, least of all that they are present.
23. My experience instances countless different demonstrable looks, not all of which could, in this way, simultaneously fix a coherent content. But bracket that point.
24. One must not, for this purpose, type experiences according to whether a pig or a peccary is to be expected. That would conflate representing with indicating.
24. I am deeply grateful to the editor of _Mind_ for his patient, insightful and no doubt time-consuming efforts for which this this essay is vastly better than it might have been. He is not thereby accountable for any views expressed. The errors are all mine.
